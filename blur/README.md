Use `ng-blur` on the two input elements to remove the `userText` when the user input loses focus, and remove the `passwordText` when the password input loses focus.

(This can be done much simpler with `ng-focus`, `ng-show`/`ng-hide`. Once you're comfortable with those directives, redo this exercise using them.)
