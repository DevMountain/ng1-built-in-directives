# Angular 1.x Built-in Directives
Each folder contains a useful result accomplished by using Angular's built-in directives. Your task is to complete the `index.html` file in order to accomplish the goal stated in that folder's `README` file. Hints and solutions are provided, but see what you can do on your own first.

In addition to the `index.html` file, you will find basic examples of the relevant directives. To run these via `live-server`, use the command `live-server <name-of-file>`.
